## üîå Electrical Domain Specifics

### Load Calculations (NEC 220)
```python
# Residential Load Calculation Example
general_lighting = square_feet * 3  # VA per sq ft
small_appliance = 1500 * 2  # Two circuits minimum
laundry = 1500  # One circuit minimum
total_general = general_lighting + small_appliance + laundry

# Apply demand factors
first_3000 = 3000 * 1.0
remaining = (total_general - 3000) * 0.35
calculated_load = first_3000 + remaining
```

### Voltage Drop Calculations (NEC 210.19)
- Maximum 3% for branch circuits
- Maximum 5% for feeders and branch combined
- Critical for long runs or sensitive equipment

### Conduit Fill (NEC Chapter 9)
- 40% fill for 3+ conductors
- Derating factors for multiple conductors
- Temperature corrections

### Circuit Breaker Sizing
- 125% continuous loads
- 100% non-continuous loads
- Ambient temperature corrections
