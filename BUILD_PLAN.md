   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Essential Configuration Files**
   - requirements.txt
   - pyproject.toml
   - .env.example
   - .gitignore
   - docker-compose.yml

### Day 1: Afternoon (4 hours)
3. **Development Environment**
   - Setup script (setup_project.py)
   - Health check script
   - Database initialization
   - Pre-commit hooks

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated testing
   - Code quality checks
   - Security scanning

### Day 2: Morning (4 hours)
5. **Core Foundation Code**
   - Base agent class
   - Quotation state models
   - Custom exceptions
   - Configuration management
   - Logging setup

6. **Testing Framework**
   - Pytest configuration
   - Test fixtures
   - Mock utilities
   - Coverage setup

### Day 2: Afternoon (4 hours)
7. **First Working Agent**
   - Header Agent implementation
   - Unit tests for Header Agent
   - Integration test setup
   - Documentation

8. **API Scaffolding**
   - FastAPI main application
   - Basic health check endpoint
   - Error handling middleware
   - CORS configuration

## üìù Detailed Implementation Order

### 1. Configuration Files First (Critical!)
These files define the entire project structure and dependencies:

#### requirements.txt
- Core: langgraph, langchain, fastapi, pydantic
- Databases: asyncpg, neo4j, redis
- AI/ML: openai, tiktoken
- Testing: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov
- Dev tools: black, isort, flake8, mypy

#### docker-compose.yml
- PostgreSQL with initialization
- Neo4j with plugins
- Redis with persistence
- Adminer for database management

### 2. Base Classes (Foundation for All Agents)
```python
# shared/models/base.py
class BaseAgent(ABC):
    """All agents inherit from this"""
    
# shared/models/state.py
class QuotationState(TypedDict):
    """Shared state for all agents"""
```

### 3. Simple Agent Implementation Pattern
Start with Header Agent as it's the simplest:
1. Create agent class
2. Implement process method
3. Add error handling
4. Create unit tests
5. Add integration tests
6. Document thoroughly

### 4. Incremental Complexity
Build agents in order of complexity:
- Level 1: Header, Footer, Company Info (templates)
- Level 2: Project Info, Contacts (data extraction)
- Level 3: Line Items, Pricing (AI-powered analysis)

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't Skip Configuration**
   - Proper setup saves weeks of debugging
   - Environment consistency is critical

2. **Test Everything Early**
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test error conditions

3. **Document as You Go**
   - Update .claude/ files with learnings
   - Keep README current
   - Add inline documentation

4. **Version Control Discipline**
   - Commit small, logical changes
   - Use conventional commits
   - Review before pushing

5. **Performance from Start**
   - Profile agent execution
   - Optimize database queries
   - Cache appropriately

## üîÑ Weekly Review Checklist

Every Friday:
- [ ] All tests passing?
- [ ] Documentation updated?
- [ ] Performance acceptable?
- [ ] Security considerations addressed?
- [ ] Next week's goals clear?

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Claude Code for Everything**
   - Let it generate boilerplate
   - Ask for test cases
   - Request documentation

2. **Iterate Quickly**
   - Get basic version working first
   - Refine incrementally
   - Don't over-engineer early

3. **Maintain Momentum**
   - Daily commits
   - Weekly demos
   - Celebrate small wins

Remember: A strong foundation enables everything else. Take time to get the basics right!
